# My Project for the course Web322

**Aim:** To implement a complete backend for a blog website with industry standard practices and dependencies

### Details:

1. Database
    * Used **PostgreSQL** using Sequelize to store the blog posts and their categories.
    * Used **MongoDB** NoSql database along with **Bcryptjs** to store the users in an encrypted manner.
    * Cloudinary was used to store the media uploaded by the users on their blogs.
2. User
    * Utilized browser **sessions** to keep track of user logins.
    * Authorized some of the routes which were only to be accessed by logged in users.
3. Misc
    * Used **handlebars** to dynamically render the front end.
    * Used **bootstrap** for the frontend.
